        Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a non-invasive method to record electrical activity of the brain. Developed in the early 20th century, it has become a fundamental tool in the fields of neurology, psychology, and cognitive sciences.

        Whenever we think, dream, feel, or move, our neurons, communicate through electrical impulses. These impulses create patterns of electrical activity that we can capture through electrodes placed on the scalp.

    An EEG records these patterns, usually as wavy lines. These oscillations, referred to as 'brain waves', are a window into our brain's functioning, offering insights into different states of consciousness like sleep, alertness, and relaxation.

    Our project, harnesses the power of EEG to study motor execution - specifically the intention to move our body. We utilize machine learning techniques to sift through the complex patterns in the EEG data, and classify those signals that correspond to our arms and hands movement intentions.
